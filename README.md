# Optimized portal rendering

It's faster than before.

The portal renderer uses Json text files made by the Marathon level converter project.

You have to add Marathon textures to it yourself, I can't include the textures.

Included are some custom textures and three levels to play with.

Tutorial is from the Bisqwit portal rendering tutorial video made with Weland.

Hyper Cube is a room with a cube with hallways that overlap on the inside of the cube.

Two Hallways is two hallways that overlap in an unnatural way.

The name in the Main script can be changed to the Json text files name in the resources folder.

Type in the name of the Json text file to change level.
