# Optimized portal rendering

It's faster than before.

The portal renderer uses Json text files made by the Marathon level converter project.

You have to add Marathon textures to it yourself, I can't include the textures.

Included are some custom textures and three levels to play with.

Tutorial is from the Bisqwit portal rendering tutorial video made with Weland.

Hyper Cube is a room with a cube with hallways that overlap on the inside of the cube.

Two Hallways is two hallways that overlap in an unnatural way.
